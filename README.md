# Welcome! 
This repo contains projects on NLP, Computer Vision, web scraping, etc., using different libraries. I'm looking forward to use libraries which are lesser known and could be potentially useful to spin up a quick prototype before using any *sophisticated* models.


# Libraries explored so far
- **[Twint](https://github.com/twintproject/twint)** for scraping Twitter Data. No limitations.
- **[TextHero](https://github.com/jbesomi/texthero)** for faster analysis on Text Data.
- **[SweetViz](https://github.com/fbdesignpro/sweetviz)** for quick Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualizations.


# Contribution
Please feel free to fork this repo, pull requests, or raise issues if you're finding any problems in following the steps mentioned in the notebooks. I am looking forward to connect with the community to learn more and better! Thank you!
